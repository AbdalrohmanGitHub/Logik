Hi Karl

Happy Easter, Karl.  Are you visiting your family or spending Easter with friends??  We are staying here in WL and 
I think we are going out tomorrow to a restaurant with Brian's brother and his family.  Then we will have our own
Easter dinner with a friend here.  Eric is flying to Ottawa today to participate in a youth program called 'Encounters
with Canada'.  He will be away for a week, coming back next Sunday.  This is the first time he is travelling alone
so I hope it goes okay for him.  
Anyway...
I finally got some time to go over the rest of your English program.  I'm not sure if I caught errors or if I think they
are just errors because I'm unfamiliar with the mathematical language you are using.  So these ideas I'm giving may
also not be correct and you can use them or ignore them... okay???
Here goes:
Pg. 16  Under example 1.  the phrase says ''...right hand sides of all TUPLES in R are different."  Should tuples be 'couples'?
I've never seen the word, 'tuples' before...
Pg. 32  Last line...   This BOOKS...  should 'books' actually  read 'book'?  singular????  Or do you want it to read "These books..."
Pg. 38  2nd to last line...  '...all those products that are BUILD form integer factors...'  I'm wondering if 'build' should read 'built'?
Pg. 42  2nd line of explanation near top...  "... operator that is BUILD by ..."  Again I wonder if this should read 'built' again?
Pg 43  after Figure 2.11  "...  isn't very USEFULL: "    spelling - useful
pg. 47  first line..."Using the operators BUILD described above..."   Do you need the word 'build'? or should it again be 'built'? 
pg. 51  after Figure 2.23  first line... "This loop will WILL only..."  take one 'will' out???,  
Pg. 51 after Figure 2.23 2nd line..." terminate when AN either an exit statement...  it might read better if you take the first 'an' out...??
Pg. 53  2nd line from top.." ...because then he would HELD traps,..."  I was wondering if 'held' should read 'hold' ????
Pg. 68  after the 2nd example and after the '= true'...  The sentence ... calculation above I DID only EVALUATE
Pg. 84  2nd to last line..." a single PROCEDURES that takes..."  perhaps change 'procedureS' to 'procedure'?

   Pg. 61  1st line after the farmer story near the end...  "...used by the farmer TP transport all trade goods..."  'TP' should maybe read 'to'.   
    Pg. 65  2nd line from top...  "concerned with formulae BUILD up from the...."  I am wondering if 'build' should again read 'built'?   
   Pg. 66  the 3rd paragraph of 1.  Analysis and design of digital circuits...  "ON such tool..."  I think 'on' should read 'one'...?????

    Pg. 68  after the 2nd example and after the '= true'...  The sentence ... "calculation above I DID only EVALUATE those parts..."

     It might read better ...  " calculation above  I only evaluated those parts..."

    Pg. 84  2nd to last line..." a single PROCEDURES that takes..."  perhaps change 'procedureS' to 'procedure'?
